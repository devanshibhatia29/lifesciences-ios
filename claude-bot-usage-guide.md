# Claude Bot Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the Claude bot to create pull requests for your NetflixClone repository.

## âœ¨ New: Official Claude Code Action

**We've upgraded to the official Anthropic claude-code-action!** This provides:

- **Built-in conciseness** - Automatically provides proportional responses
- **Better reliability** - Professionally maintained by Anthropic  
- **Simpler configuration** - No more custom Python scripts to maintain
- **Enhanced code understanding** - Better repository analysis capabilities

## Proportional Response Sizing

Claude now provides responses proportional to the complexity of your request:

- **Simple fixes** (typos, one-liners): Brief responses with minimal explanation
- **Small features**: Concise explanations with targeted code changes  
- **Complex features**: Detailed analysis and comprehensive implementation
- **Bug fixes**: Short problem description + solution

This means you'll get appropriately-sized responses instead of overly verbose explanations for simple tasks.
